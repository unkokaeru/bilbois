> [!IMPORTANT] Task
> We would like you to **perform a competitor analysis** for us. This will involve looking at how **Lone Star Analysis (LSA**) presents itself online compared to its competitors, then creating **actionable suggestions** regarding the online presence of LSA.

## Five Phases of the Project (*over 8 weeks*)

### **Phase 1**: Project Kick-off

A presentation at the University of Lincoln followed by questions.

>[!HINT]
>Familiarise yourself with Lone Star Analysis (LSA) before the meeting! To do this, create a [[Initial Impressions of Lone Star Analysis]] document.

Assign roles, discuss timelines, the results of the projects, the methods to reach these results, etc. - all discussed in the [[Enterprise Project Initial Meeting Notes]].

### **Phase 2:** Identification

Lone Star Analysis (LSA) will provide an initial list of example competitors, as well as the following points of competition to discuss:

1. Problems they compete to solve.
2. Solutions they compete to provide.
3. Employee-types they compete to hire.
4. Brands they compete to build.
5. Locations they compete to work within.

Based on these points, you should perform a thematic analysis of the [LSA website](https://lone-star.uk/) and any other online presence LSA has. Using this analysis, research a long-list of other potential competitors to analyse, with reasoning, to then present to LSA and short-list competitors to focus on.

### **Phase 3:** Analysis

Meet with Lone Star Analysis (LSA) to choose appropriate analysis approaches (framework/techniques/methods relevant to Phase 2's points of competition).

>[!HINT]
>Do some reading and research before the meeting!

Use these analysis approaches to research potential analysis tasks and questions, such as:

- What is LSA's search engine optimisation (SEO) like for its role in the UK and how does this relate to competitors?
- What does LSA's online presence look like on places like YouTube and LinkedIn?
- How does LSA's employee benefits compare to competitors?
- What is the feel of LSA's website? Modern, professional, defence, boring, etc.?

These questions will be mainly answered with independent research, subject matter experts (SMEs) could be approached for help and/or guidance.

LSA will then hold a mini workshop to "Collect, Choose, Create, and Commit" to the set of analysis questions.

After this, you should use the chosen analysis questions/approaches to compare and contrast the online content of three companies, of LSA's choosing, from the short-list created in Phase 2. Focus on the aforementioned points of competition.

### **Phase 4:** Recommendations

List actionable recommendations that Lone Star Analysis (LSA) can implement to improve or change the website and the rest of their online presence. These recommendations should focus solely on this online presence, not their business or operations.

Prioritise this list for impact against effort to complete.

### **Phase 5:** Findings and Recommendations Workshop

Lone Star Analysis (LSA) and the University of Lincoln (students) will hold a second mini-workshop on analysis and recommendations, where you'll focus on capturing and documenting LSA's views on impact, feasibility, and timelines.

### **Phase 6:** Presentation

To conclude to Enterprise Project, you'll present your analysis finding, suggestions, and mini-workshop discussions, where the specific structure of the accompanying document should be agreed with LSA.

***==If LSA deems the document to be useful, then the project is a success.==***
