Let $n$, $M$, $d$, and $q$ be natural numbers. A code $C$ called an $(n,M,d)_{q}$-code when...

- the underlying alphabet used for $C$ has $q$ symbols,
- each codeword in $C$ has length $n$,
- $C$ itself has $M$ codewords in total, i.e. $M=|C|=\#C$, and
- $d$ is its minimal distance, i.e. $d=d_{\text{min}}(C)$.

These numbers $n$, $M$, $d$, and $q$ are called the **parameters** of $C$.

*Note: if the number of symbols $q$ is not important in the context, we sometimes omit $q$ and simply say that $C$ is an $(n,M,d)$-code.*
