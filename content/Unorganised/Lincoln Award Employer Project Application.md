My interests include chess, where I hold the title of Arena FIDE Master (1623 ELO), programming, and learning languages such as Japanese (casual), French (B1), and German (B1).

In terms of work experience, I have collaborated as a Research Team Member at the British Sugar Biofuel Plant, where I identified inefficiencies in biofuel production and honed my public speaking skills. Additionally, I have been a self-employed tutor since October 2020, providing support in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics to GCSE and A-Level students, while managing all aspects of my tutoring business.

I am particularly interested in exploring career opportunities in data analysis or engineering, where I can apply my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities, although I'm still exploring adjacent fields. Participating in one of your projects excites me because it offers a chance to collaborate with like-minded individuals, gain practical experience, and contribute to meaningful solutions in a dynamic environment.

I can bring a range of valuable skills to the project. My experience as a self-employed tutor has equipped me with the ability to convey complex concepts clearly and effectively, ensuring that all team members are aligned. I have a proven ability to work collaboratively, as demonstrated during my time as a Research Team Member at the British Sugar Biofuel Plant, where I contributed positively to diverse team dynamics.

I am very proficient in the Python programming language, which I have utilised in various projects and coursework. Additionally, my studies in mathematics at the University of Lincoln have provided me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking and quantitative reasoning.

I also possess a strong customer service orientation, having learned the importance of understanding client needs through my tutoring experience. My interests in programming and language learning reflect my adaptability and willingness to embrace new challenges.

While working on the project, I would like to gain actual experience using the skills I have already developed, particularly in teamwork and collaboration. Engaging with a diverse group of individuals will allow me to further hone my ability to work effectively within a team, learning from different perspectives and approaches.

I also seek to apply my proficiency in Python and mathematics in a practical setting. By tackling real-world problems, I can refine my technical skills and deepen my understanding of how to leverage these tools effectively. This hands-on experience is essential for solidifying my knowledge and preparing me for future career opportunities.
