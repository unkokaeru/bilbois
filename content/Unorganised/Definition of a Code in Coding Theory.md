Given $n \in N$, a finite sequence $x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{i}$ with every $x_{i}$ belonging to the alphabet $A$ is called a **word** (or **vector** or **message**) of length $n$ over $A$. Such a word can also be viewed as an element $(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{i})\in A^{n}$. A **$q$-ary code** (over $A$) of length $n$ is just a subset $C\subset A^{n}$. A (valid) **codeword** is an element of $C$.
