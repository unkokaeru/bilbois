**GitHub repository**: https://github.com/unkokaeru/lincoln-logbook/.

Think about using pandoc to render the markdown the html, too, then hosting that on GitHub pages.

**Reflection** markdown documents should answer the following questions:
- What did you learn in the lab tasks this week? (incl. explanation)
- How well did I learn it?
- How does my solution compare with the official solution?
- How can I extend the concepts used in the tasks to form a new project?

Include **flowcharts** when explaining code when requested or, if I can auto-generate them based on comments (and using Mermaid/Excalidraw?), always.

Reference books and other resources as points of education throughout the logbook, with a single **references** list at the end of the logbook.
