I have been fortunate enough to gather a wealth of experience working in an educational setting, as well as a challenging year in an acute hospital setting. I am grateful for praise as an effective, diligent, self-motivated, and cooperative team member. I strive to achieve efficiency and thereby a positive working atmosphere; often seeking to work with my peers to improve the working environment and myself in the process. I am looking forward to continuing my journey to becoming a Speech and Language Therapist and building on the knowledge and experiences I have gained throughout my life and my ongoing education.
