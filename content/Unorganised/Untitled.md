### Topic 2: Lagrangian Mechanics

**1. Principle of Least Action:**
   - The principle of least action states that the path taken by a system between two states is the one for which the action integral is minimized (or made stationary).
   - The action $S$ is defined as:
     $$
     S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L \, dt
     $$
   where $L$ is the Lagrangian of the system.

**2. Lagrangian Definition:**
   - The Lagrangian $L$ is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy $T$ and the potential energy $V$ of the system:
     $$
     L = T - V
     $$
   - For a simple system, the kinetic energy is often expressed as $T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$ and potential energy can vary depending on the forces acting on the system.

**3. Generalized Coordinates:**
   - Generalized coordinates $q_i$ are used to describe the configuration of a system in a way that may not correspond to Cartesian coordinates.
   - They can simplify the analysis of complex systems, especially when constraints are present.

**4. Constructing the Lagrangian:**
   - Identify the kinetic and potential energies of the system.
   - Write the Lagrangian as $L = T - V$.

### Topic 3: Euler-Lagrange Equation

**1. Derivation of the Euler-Lagrange Equation:**
   - The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived from the principle of least action. It provides a way to find the equations of motion for a system described by a Lagrangian.
   - The equation is given by:
     $$
     \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0
     $$
   where $q_i$ are the generalized coordinates and $\dot{q}_i$ are their time derivatives (velocities).

**2. Steps to Apply the Euler-Lagrange Equation:**
   - **Step 1**: Write down the Lagrangian $L$ for the system.
   - **Step 2**: Compute the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}$ and $\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}$.
   - **Step 3**: Substitute these derivatives into the Euler-Lagrange equation.
   - **Step 4**: Solve the resulting differential equation to find the equations of motion.

**3. Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator**
   - For a mass $m$ on a spring with spring constant $k$:
     - Kinetic energy: $T = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2$
     - Potential energy: $V = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$
     - Lagrangian: $L = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2 - \frac{1}{2} k x^2$
   - Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation:
     $$
     \frac{d}{dt} \left( m \dot{x} \right) + kx = 0
     $$
   - This leads to the familiar equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator:
     $$
     m \ddot{x} + kx = 0
     $$

### Summary
- Lagrangian mechanics provides a powerful framework for analyzing mechanical systems using energy concepts.
