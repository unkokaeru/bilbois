Given a metric space $X$ with distance function $d$ and a positive real number $\epsilon\in \mathbb{R}_{\gt0}$, the **solid sphere** (or **ball**) or radius $\epsilon$ and center $p\in X$ is the set defined by
$$
S_{\epsilon}(p)=\set{x\in X:d(p,x)\le \epsilon}
$$
In the case where $X$ is finite, the **volume** of the (solid) sphere $S_{\epsilon}(p)$ is its number of elements $|S_{\epsilon}(p)|=\#S_{\epsilon}(p)$.

This doesn't have to be an actual sphere, its just an area where the distance between two vertices is constant.
