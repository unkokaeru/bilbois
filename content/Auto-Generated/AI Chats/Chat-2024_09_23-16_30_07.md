**ai**: ## Direct Products of Groups/Sets

The **direct product** of two algebraic structures, such as groups or sets, is a way to combine them into a new structure. If we have two groups \( G \) and \( H \), their direct product, denoted \( G \times H \), consists of all ordered pairs \( (g, h) \) where \( g \in G \) and \( h \in H \). The operation on this product is defined component-wise.

### Definition

For \( G \) and \( H \) to form a direct product \( G \times H \), the following must hold:
1. **Closure**: If \( (g_1, h_1), (g_2, h_2) \in G \times H \), then \( (g_1, h_1) * (g_2, h_2) = (g_1 * g_2, h_1 * h_2) \) is also in \( G \times H \).
2. **Associativity**: The operation is associative, meaning \( ((g_1, h_1) * (g_2, h_2)) * (g_3, h_3) = (g_1, h_1) * ((g_2, h_2) * (g_3, h_3)) \).
3. **Identity Element**: The identity element of \( G \times H \) is \( (e_G, e_H) \), where \( e_G \) and \( e_H \) are the identity elements of \( G \) and \( H \), respectively.
4. **Inverses**: For each \( (g, h) \in G \times H \), there exists an inverse \( (g^{-1}, h^{-1}) \) such that \( (g, h) * (g^{-1}, h^{-1}) = (e_G, e_H) \).

### Examples

1. **Example with Groups**: Let \( G = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) (the integers modulo 2) and \( H = \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) (the integers modulo 3). The direct product \( G \times H \) consists of the pairs \( (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) \). This set forms a group under component-wise addition modulo 2 and 3, respectively.

2. **Example with Sets**: Consider two sets \( A = \{1, 2\} \) and \( B = \{x, y\} \). The direct product \( A \times B \) is the set of ordered pairs \( \{(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)\} \). While this is not a group, it illustrates the concept of combining sets.

### Conclusion

The direct product of groups is itself a group, provided that the original structures are groups. This construction allows for the exploration of more complex algebraic structures by combining simpler ones, enriching our understanding of their properties and behaviors.
