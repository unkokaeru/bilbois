**ai**: It looks like you've successfully created a new Python project using Cookiecutter, but there were some issues during the setup process. Hereâ€™s a summary of what happened and some steps you can take to resolve the issues:

### Summary of the Process
1. **Project Initialization**: You provided details for the project, including author information and project description.
2. **Git Repository**: A new Git repository was initialized successfully.
3. **Virtual Environment**: A virtual environment was created, but there was an issue with activating it.
4. **Dependency Installation**: The script attempted to install dependencies using Poetry, but it seems that Poetry is not installed or not recognized in your environment.
5. **Exporting Requirements**: The script tried to export requirements but failed due to the absence of Poetry.
6. **Linting Checks**: A linting script was called but could not be found.
7. **Git Commit**: The initial commit was made successfully, but it only included untracked files.

### Steps to Resolve Issues

1. **Install Poetry**:
   - If you haven't installed Poetry yet, you can do so by following the instructions on the [Poetry installation page](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
   - After installation, ensure that the Poetry executable is in your system's PATH.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - Navigate to your project directory and activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - If you're using Git Bash or a similar terminal, you might need to use:
     ```bash
     source .venv/Scripts/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Once the virtual environment is activated, run:
     ```bash
     poetry install
     ```
   - This should install the dependencies specified in your `pyproject.toml`.

4. **Check for Missing Scripts**:
   - The linting script (`scripts/lint-and-format.sh`) was not found. Ensure that this script exists or create it if necessary. You can also check the project template to see if it should have been included.

5. **Export Requirements**:
   - After installing Poetry, you can manually export the requirements if needed:
     ```bash
     poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Commit Changes**:
   - After resolving the issues, you can add and commit any changes to your Git repository:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Fix setup issues"
     ```

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issues encountered during the project setup. If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific commands, feel free to ask!
