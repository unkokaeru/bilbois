**user**: Read my [[Brother CV]] and [[Mother CV]]. They're older and more experienced than me, I'm still an undergraduate student without any formal work experience beyond being a self-employed tutor for the past few years alongside my studies. I want a job in retail though (like Tesco). Please write me a CV that can help me with this, that I can then refine and tweak to my liking - I just need help starting. Before doing so, ask me as many questions as you need to ascertain what to write about - I'd rather ask 100 questions than have a bad result from you.

Thank you!

**ai**: Great! To help you create a CV tailored for a retail position, I’ll need to gather some information about your background, skills, and preferences. Here are some questions to get us started:

8. Have you had any other informal work experiences (e.g., volunteering, internships) that could be relevant to a retail position?

2. 07578 127943, william@fayers.com
3. https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-fayers/, https://bilbois.me/
4. BSc (Hons) Mathematics at the University of Lincoln
5. Second year
6. I did a group project which involved a lot of teamwork and communication, if that counts? I was the secretary in the group, so I mainly handled communication, organisation/timings and resolving internal conflict, as well as more standard note taking and contribution to the group project.
7. I teach maths as I enjoy it and it helps me pass on the knowledge I learn in my day-to-day, as well as chemistry and physics (my two other former A-Level specialities) to try and stay on top of old knowledge so I don't forget the interesting things I've learned. Generally, I just do it to help my community, though - it's very rewarding. I've learned how to deal with customers in a professional manner and motivate unwilling students to try their best, as well as learning to understand what my students are thinking; whilst often it feels like what they're feeling or thinking is unreasonable or illogical, it's often understandable once you try to think like they do and empathise with their situation - usually you're just not seeing the whole picture, so I've learned that it really helps to try and understand the student, or customer, when providing them a service, to ensure every goes smoothly.
8. I often volunteered with the Air Cadets before going to university and I've been in student leader positions throughout my entire education, if that counts?
9. I handle cash when tutoring and provide customer service when tutoring.
10. The stereotypical ones - you can get these from what I've said and extrapolation of my character, I can always correct them (just assume I'm perfect I guess).
11. No.
12. Part-time at the weekend, once I have a timetable for my second year of uni then this might open up more to times during weekdays or evenings.
13. Weekends.
14. No.
15. I want to gain more experience working directly with customers in person as well as working within a team to hopefully help me with future career aspirations.
16. I love chess, programming, learning languages like Japanese French German, as well as crochet and painting, and reading books, going to the gym and playing pool with friends.

If you have any further questions before you build the CV, please ask!

**ai**: Thank you for providing such detailed information! This will help create a strong CV for your retail job application. Before I draft the CV, I have a few more questions to ensure we capture everything accurately:

### Additional Questions
1. **References**: Would you like to include references on your CV, or would you prefer to state that they are available upon request?
2. **Objective Statement**: Would you like to include a brief objective statement at the top of your CV to summarize your goals and what you bring to a retail position?
3. **Formatting Preferences**: Do you have any specific formatting preferences (e.g., font style, color, layout) for your CV?
4. **Achievements**: Are there any specific achievements or recognitions from your tutoring or volunteer experiences that you would like to highlight?
5. **Location**: Would you like to include your address or just your city and postcode?

Once I have this information, I can create a draft CV for you!

**user**: 1. I guess they'd be available upon request? I'm not sure what would be expected here or who could even be one - maybe my tutor?
2. If that's normal, yes.
3. Markdown, similar to what you read at the beginning of our conversion.
4. I've been lucky enough to get an Arkwright Engineering Scholarship, among a plethora of other things but I guess you only need one.
5. Lincoln, LN1 1UR.

Oh also, do you want my GCSE and A-Levels before you draft the CV?

**ai**: Thank you for the additional details! Including your GCSE and A-Level information will definitely enhance your CV, especially since you're still an undergraduate. Please provide the following:

1. **A-Level Subjects and Grades**: What subjects did you take, and what grades did you achieve?
2. **GCSE Subjects and Grades**: What subjects did you take, and what grades did you achieve?

Once I have that information, I can draft your CV!

**user**: 1. Extended Project (Level 3) Grade A, Chemistry Grade C, Physics Grade C, Further Mathematics Grade B, Mathematics Grade A
2. Free-Standing Mathematics Qualification Grade A, Grade 7: Astronomy, English Language, Biology, Grade 8: History, German, French, English Literature, Computer Science, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics
