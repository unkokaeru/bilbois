*Oral care forms a crucial part of my health routine. It involves flossing, brushing, tongue scraping, mouth rinsing, and teeth whitening.*

### Flossing

Flossing helps get between your teeth before brushing. It covers about 40% of your tooth surface, so not flossing is similar to not washing your legs in the shower. Regular flossing helps prevent plaque, tartar, inflammation, and eventual bone loss leading to missing teeth.

### Brushing

Brushing not only cleans your teeth but also your gums. A significant part of brushing should be at the border between your teeth and gums. To reach the back of your teeth, move your jaw along with the area you're trying to clean. Both electric and manual toothbrushes can be effective, but studies show that electric toothbrushes can be more efficient when used correctly.

### Tongue Scraping

Tongue scraping helps freshen breath by removing sulphur compounds and bacteria from the back of your tongue. You can use a toothbrush for the same purpose, but a hard scraper tends to be more efficient at removing the "gunk."

### Mouth Rinse

A non-alcohol mouth rinse with a pH greater than 5.5 helps remineralise your teeth. It reaches areas that are easy to miss. However, ensure the rinse is not too acidic (less than 5.5 pH), which can demineralise your teeth. Also, avoid alcohol-containing mouth rinses as they can dry out your mouth, increasing the risk of cavities.

### Whitening

Teeth, by their nature, come in a variety of hues and shades, including yellow. The prevailing societal beauty standard, however, promotes the idea of perfectly white teeth. This standard, when met, can potentially have a positive impact on an individual's mental health, as it could boost self-esteem and confidence.

In our daily diet, we consume numerous colourful and acidic foods and drinks that can lead to the staining of our teeth. This includes items such as coffee, tea, red wine, and certain fruits like berries. Despite their potential to stain, it's important to note that these foods and drinks can be enjoyed without causing permanent damage to the colour of our teeth. A simple preventive measure is to rinse the mouth with water immediately after consumption. This strategy helps to remove the staining compounds before they have a chance to adhere to the tooth enamel.

However, it's important to remember that brushing your teeth should be avoided for at least half an hour after eating or drinking these substances. Contrary to what one might think, brushing within the first half-hour can actually exacerbate the staining. This is because the acidity from the food or drink can temporarily soften the tooth enamel, making it more susceptible to abrasion from brushing.

To combat existing stains, there are a number of methods one can use. One particularly effective method is the use of hydrogen peroxide, a common ingredient in many whitening products. Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the stains, effectively breaking them down and revealing a whiter surface underneath. 

Another method is mechanical stain removal, which can be performed by a dentist or dental hygienist. This process involves physically removing the stains using special dental tools. While this method can be quite effective, it's important to note that it should be done under professional supervision to avoid damaging the tooth enamel.

In conclusion, maintaining a healthy and aesthetically pleasing smile involves understanding the nature of teeth, practicing good dietary habits, and using appropriate stain removal methods.
