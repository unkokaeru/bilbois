## Personal Summary
*Summarise your key skills and achievements, including positive words that describe you as a person. Highlight the roles you've held and key achievements to date, but avoid anything that narrows down your options too much.*

I am a dedicated and adaptable second-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Mathematics at the University of Lincoln, where I am on track for a First Class degree with a 97% average. My experience as a Research Team Member at the British Sugar Biofuel Plant has honed my teamwork and public speaking skills, allowing me to effectively collaborate with diverse groups to identify and solve complex problems. As a self-employed tutor, I have developed strong communication and interpersonal skills, successfully supporting students in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics while managing all aspects of my tutoring business. I am recognised for my excellent customer service and have a proven ability to convey complex concepts clearly. My interests in programming, particularly in Python, and my passion for strategic thinking through chess reflect my analytical mindset and commitment to continuous learning.

## Interests & Hobbies

In my spare time, I enjoy playing chess, where I hold the title of Arena FIDE Master with a 1623 ELO rating, which allows me to practice strategic thinking and problem-solving. I am also passionate about programming and software development, continually seeking to enhance my skills in Python. Additionally, I am learning languages, including Japanese (casual), French (B1), and German (B1), which reflects my enthusiasm for cultural exploration and adaptability. These interests not only enrich my personal life but also contribute to my academic and professional development.
