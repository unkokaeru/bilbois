Let $C$ be a code and $d$ its Hamming distance function. The **(minimum) distance** of $C$, denoted by $d_{\text{min}}(C)$, is the smallest Hamming distance possible achieved by two (distinct) codewords of $C$.

Mathematically,
$$
d_{\text{min}}(C):=\text{min}\set{d(c_{1},c_{2}):c_{1},c_{2}\in C,c_{1}\ne c_{2}}
$$
