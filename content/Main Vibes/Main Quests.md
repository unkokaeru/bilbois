## Personal

### Programming

- [ ] Refine main GitHub repos (from [[../Organised/Applications/CVs/Placement CV|Placement CV]]).
- [ ] *I wonder if I can make my CI auto-add an issue if the pipeline fails at any point?*
- [ ] **Abraham Markdown**.
	- [ ] Refine [[Abraham Data Dictionaries]].
	- [ ] Use classes for everything and 4o-mini for content generation.
	- [ ] Extend to generate GCSE and A-Level content.
	- [ ] Extend to generate lecture/session recaps with questions, generalised to use for tutoring session recaps, too. Could implement something with Excalidraw templating within Obsidian.
	- [ ] Convert to a website?
- [ ] Tamago Time.
	- [ ] Look into what APIs exist and what other information sources I could use: summarised Atrioc transcripts, FT summaries, placement site APIs, anilist API for new anime, Lichess/Chess.com API.
	- [ ] Generate morning briefings: summarise overwhelming information, like jobs, placements, and emails, even social media if I figure out how.
- [ ] Quick and Artful Response Code Generator.
	- [ ] Implement basic QR code generation.
	- [ ] Extend to create patterns from images by manipulating the underlying mathematics.
	- [ ] Port to a Chrome extension.
- [ ] A Normal Rating System.
	- [ ] Fix how `file_handling.py` handles file encoding - I think `csv_reader` can't read unicode.
	- [ ] Implement an algorithm to help the user rate a list of items from 1-10 just with direct comparisons, ensuring the output follows a normal distribution.
	- [ ] Use the [GraphQL AniList API](https://docs.anilist.co/) to export and import based on username etc. ([[Anilist API info]])
- [ ] Chess Doppelganger.
	- [ ] Implement a simple chess engine.
	- [ ] Extend with a simple chess AI.
	- [ ] Implement the ability for the AI to learn how to mimic how the user plays.
- [ ] Random Challenges.
	- [ ] [[Convenience Store Challenge]].
	- [ ] [[Video Length Conversion Challenge]].
	- [ ] [[Count True Challenge]].
	- [ ] [[Pig Latin Challenge]].
	- [ ] [[Ping Pong Challenge]].

### Other Stuff

- [ ] Can I modify the Obsidian presentation view to generate presentations in a similar style to the university? i.e. section header at the top, progress bar and page number at the bottom, colour scheme, fonts, definition (etc.) callout box style.
- [ ] Quartz Digital Garden.
	- [ ] Add correct "Created" and "Last Modified" headers to Quartz notes.
	- [ ] [[Convert buttons to markdown on render]].
	- [ ] [[Convert folder overview to markdown on render]].
	- [ ] Convert Excalidraw to `.svg` images (using `ExcalidrawAutomate`) on render.
	- [ ] Look into additional components used by [LesleyLai's Digital Garden](https://github.com/LesleyLai/digital-garden).
	- [ ] AFTER: Upgrade my USB to automatically setup Obsidian/Quartz.
- [ ] Upgrade my USB to automatically setup Arc and VS Code.
- [ ] De-Google.
	- [ ] [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium).
	- [ ] Self-host photos.
	- [ ] Self-host cloud storage.

>[!NOTE]
>Tasks in **bold** are important/time-sensitive, tasks in *italics* are easy or quick, and other tasks are ranked in order of importance, normally. Sections that have times associated with them represent the hours required to complete every week, otherwise it's flexible from week to week. Timed tasks are just options for filling those required hours.
