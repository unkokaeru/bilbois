>[!NOTE]
>Tasks in **bold** are important/time-sensitive, tasks in *italics* are easy or quick, and other tasks are ranked in order of importance, normally. Sections that have times associated with them represent the hours required to complete every week, otherwise it's flexible from week to week. Timed tasks are just options for filling those required hours.
