> [!Note]
> The code block below is a button I use to sync and build my vault notes with Quartz. It may look like random code here, but it helps keep everything updated in my workspace.

```meta-bind-button
label: Sync Quartz
icon: ""
hidden: false
class: ""
tooltip: ""
id: ""
style: default
actions:
  - type: command
    command: python-scripter:run-sync_quartz.py
